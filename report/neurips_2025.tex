\title{PromptGen: Dataset Compiler for LLM Verification}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  Compiling a large dataset of domain-specific prompts and correct answers.  Auto-generating datasets for LLM verification 
  is a non-trivial task that PromptGen will tackle.  Using constraint based programming, PromptGen will auto generate a large 
  set of prompts along with corresponding answers to verify and finetune/repair an LLM.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}


Despite high performance accuracies in modern LLMs, 
these models are still prone to unpredictably producing hallucinated outputs.
 Often, the problem is in verifying whether an LLM is good at a certain task. 
 Another way of thinking about this problem is to think about generating a corpus of 
 text that is good enough to fine-tune an LLM for a certain downstream task. We aim to chip 
 away at this problem by proposing a method that will allow domain experts to codify constraints
  that exist in their domain, which can be used to generate a dataset to fine-tune/repair an LLM or use 
  it to verify the effectiveness of an already fine-tuned LLM.




\subsection{Problem Being Addressed}


Our goal is to create a domain-specific compiler that can dynamically generate huge amounts of prompts along with their correct answers, given a set of constraints about a specific domain.  The purpose of creating these datasets is to evaluate the LLM on its knowledge of the specific domain.

\subsection{Key Insights}


For the chosen domain, our key insight is aiming to encode constraints using Prolog, which is a logic-based programming language that allows the user to specify relationships in a declarative way.  Our system will take these Prolog predicates, and natural-language metadata per predicate to be able to generate a large variety of natural language prompts and answers which can then be used to verify LLMs or even fine-tune them.  

\subsection{Evaluation and Expected Outcomes}
The generated datasets will be both quantitatively and empirically evaluated.  We’ll use quantitative scores such as the BLEU score to determine how similar the NLG prompts are to human written prompts.  For empirical evaluation, we’ll run both generated and human written prompts into an LLM such as Llama or NanoGPT.  The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the effectiveness of the generated prompts by seeing how many of those prompts cause hallucinated outputs by the LLM compared to the handwritten prompts.  Our expectation is the generated prompts will be closely related to the human written prompts in terms of natural language, and the generated prompts will be more likely to detect hallucinations in an LLM because of its large quantity of prompts.

\subsection{Examples}
Below is a small sample of the Prolog constraints and the Natural Language Constraint annotations provided by the user.


--insert the files logic.pl and annotations--

The logic.pl file defines a set of facts and relations.  Facts associate words with user defined data types (eg. person(Alice)), or can define
a relation between two words (eg. like(alice, pizza)).


The annotations.txt file is where the user can define the type inheritance structure from the built in classes.  It is also where the user can define the meta data associated with the
facts and relations, which essentially provides information on some natural language constraints.  For example, the user can specify some temporal constraints for relations (eg. verb phrase = "likes" tells the system that the relationship is of present simple tense).
The user can also map these relations to some high level templates such as binary relation.  In our backend, we'll have some database of different of English, such as adjectives, verbs, nouns, pronouns, etc.  The high level templates will map to certain permutations of these sets to create natural langauge 
prompts.  Below is a set of sample questions and answers from the above constraints and natural language annotations:

\section{Related Work}
\label{gen_inst}

In the following section we present a similar work utilizing constraint based LLM verification, along with its limitations and challenges.

\subsection{End User LLM Verification}


Similar works in the past include VeriPlan, a self-verification LLM system that formally verifies and corrects the outputs of LLM models for planning tasks based on user prompts.  The key steps of VeriPlan include translating the rules, changing flexibility and checking the model outputs.  It utilizes a mapping agent which is LLM-based to extract the constraints from a user’s prompt.  This includes temporal constraints that are time-based constraints on the prompts so that they make logical sense.  The flexibility sliders allow users to choose the strictness of the constraints so the constraints have weights while rejecting the model outputs.  If the model is rejected, the requirement violations are fed back into the LLM over several iterations until the LLM outputs according to the constraints.  If the LLM doesn’t output correctly even after iterations, the user has the option to change constraints and flexibilities.

A main limitation of the VeriPlan system is that it is constrained to a small set of prompts for scheduling events based on temporal constraints.  Our hope is to include a more diverse range of prompts with our set of constraints.  The VeriPlan system needed the user on the loop to adjust constraints or change their flexibilities based on results despite only a small class of constraints.   However, PromptGen will ensure that the generated natural language sets are accurate based on the constraints to avoid the user having to check them.  We anticipate the natural language correctness guarantee to be the most challenging for PromptGen, so we’ll start off with a subset of English for greater feasibility.


\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Research Questions the Experiment is Designed to Answer}
The main experimental questions that we are trying to answer are if we can generate many natural language prompts and accurate answers with an enhanced logic program as input. We think this experimental question is significant because it allows us to explore a very different approach to LLM verification than has been taken in the past. In our approach, the evaluation dataset is NOT handwritten, but “declared” by a programmer through a logic program to encode constraints that exist in the data for a particular domain, and a few extra natural language annotation constraints to assist our system in generating question and answer pairs, which can be used to evaluate the local effectiveness of an LLM in that particular domain.

\subsection{Datasets Used}
The main dataset that we are using for the experiments is a database called Geobase. This contains both prolog facts about important geographic facts about the United States Geography, and some natural language prompts (Question and Answer Pairs). This is the right dataset for this experiment because it is a complex, logic-based domain, which are the exact parameters of our system. Additionally, it also contains Question Answer Pairs, which we can use to cross-check with the type of Question Answer Pairs that our system can generate. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of our system by using the Question Answer Pairs in the dataset as the “ground truth” prompts, to measure the expressiveness of our system, which is the main goal of our experiments.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}


The evaluation metrics will be a two-stage evaluation metric. 


The first stage of our evaluation metric will be a quantitative measure that measures the coverage difference between the prompts (Question Answer Pairs) that our system can generate vs the prompts that exist in the geobase system.  We hope to show that our declarative system allows the programmer to express equally or more complex prompts than those in the geobase dataset, and also show that the generated prompts can cover the underlying domain better than the existing prompts in the geobase dataset. A specific quantitative metric we’ll use is the BLEU score.  This is a score between the range 0 and 1 that is indicative of how similar a machine generated natural language sentence is to that written by a human.  We’ll hand pick prompts from the geobase that are similar to the ones generated by the system and compute the BLEU score on them to quantify how similar the prompts are to human natural language.


The second stage of our evaluation metric will be an empirical measure to try to express the benefit of using our system vs existing solutions to LLM verification. We will measure the programmer time (the time it takes to write the code to feed into our system) vs the human time to handwrite prompts for the same domain, and the failure rate of the LLM of the programmed vs human evaluation sets (higher failure rate of the LLM is better, because it means the question was too complex for the LLM to answer) for a small and simple domain. Our domain of choice is Computer Science Undergraduate Advising.


\subsection{Baselines}
As mentioned before, the main baseline that we are comparing our system to is the prompts (Question Answer Pairs) that already exist in the geobase dataset. Our main evaluation criterion is coverage difference, which illustrates how much of the geobase prompts our system can recreate. This is to show that the results of our system is at least as good as human written evaluation sets (the main way to currently evaluate LLMs) and we hope to convince the reader through empirical evidence, that even if the best case result is to recreate the prompts the human can generate, that the declarative and programmatic style of our approach to LLM evaluation dataset generation is cheaper, faster, and easier to change when the underlying requirements of the domain change.

% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}


% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2025+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}


% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
% argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2025}
% \end{verbatim}


% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


% \subsection{Footnotes}


% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


% \subsection{Figures}


% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}


% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.



% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.

% \section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
% limit. 

% Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
%     \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA). 
%    % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
% \end{itemize}

% {\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

% The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

% IMPORTANT, please:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS Paper Checklist"},
%     \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
%     \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
% \end{itemize} 
 

% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


% \begin{enumerate}

% \item {\bf Claims}
%     \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
%         \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
%         \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
%         \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Limitations}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
%         \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
%         \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
%         \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
%         \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
%         \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Theory assumptions and proofs}
%     \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 
%         \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
%         \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
%         \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. 
%         \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
%         \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experimental result reproducibility}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
%         \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
%         \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
%         \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
%         \begin{enumerate}
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
%             \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
%             \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
%         \end{enumerate}
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Open access to data and code}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
%         \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
%         \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
%         \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
%         \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
%         \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Experimental setting/details}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
%         \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Experiment statistical significance}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
%         \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
%         \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
%         \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
%         \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
%         \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
%         \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
%         \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
%     \end{itemize}

%         \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
%         \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 
%         \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). 
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Code of ethics}

%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
%         \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
%         \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

% \item {\bf Broader impacts}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
%         \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
%         \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
%         \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
%         \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
%         \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Safeguards}

%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
%         \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
%         \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
%         \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%         \item Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
%         \item According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
